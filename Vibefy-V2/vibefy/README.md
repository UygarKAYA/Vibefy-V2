**_Getting Started with Create React App_**

**_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)_**

**_Available Scripts_**

**_In the project directory, you can run:_**

**_`npm start`_**

**_Runs the app in the development mode._**\
**_Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser._**

**_The page will reload if you make edits._**\
**_You will also see any lint errors in the console._**

**_`npm test`_**

**_Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode._**\
**_See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information._**

**_`npm run build`_**

**_Builds the app for production to the `build` folder._**\
**_It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance._**

**_The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes._**
**_Your app is ready to be deployed!_**

**_See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information._**

**_`npm run eject`_**

**_Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!_**

**_If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time._**\
**_This command will remove the single build dependency from your project._**

**_Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own._**

**_You don’t have to ever use `eject`._**\
**_The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it._**
